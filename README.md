#About me
##My Interests
I **thoroughly** enjoy reading, playing video games, and playing tennis. _Though_ I haven't had a ton of time to do many of these things, I always try to make time. I also like learning new things, trying to expand my arsenal of knowledge wherever I go.
##Websites I recommend

* Videos that teach me something new
[_Interesting things_] happen here, such as:
* Views expressed through the eyes of many people
* Knowledge and experience are passed down
* Arguments and silly banter
